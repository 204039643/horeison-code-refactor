# Horiseon Website Code Refactor

Even though the actual visual layout remains completely unchanged, both the index.html and style.css files have been refactored. Updates includes using proper HTML elements for accessibility, re-organized and logical layout for readbility that is inline with proper HTML page structure, added commenting, and consolidation of re-used class properties in the style sheet.
